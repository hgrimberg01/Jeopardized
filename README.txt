Jeopardized was orignally made to make classroom games of jeopardy using smartboards(tm) very easy by allowing
the instructor to preload questions,answers and time limits. The state of what questions are available is also tracked.

Ideally, everything would be then saved into a renamed .zip/.cab file for easy portablity, but this unimplemented.

AGAIN THIS IS UNFINISHED. I haven't touched it since my second year of high school.
